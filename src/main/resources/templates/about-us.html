<!--                        <p class="card-text">As a front-end developer for the ParPal golf application, my primary objective was to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface that made the user experience exceptional. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop a responsive and user-friendly design that allowed users to easily search for golf courses, create events, find events, and connect with other golfers. I also implemented the use of the Google Maps and calendar APIs to enhance the application's usability and functionality. The integration of these APIs helped users to locate courses and schedule events effortlessly. Additionally, I utilized Bootstrap to ensure a consistent design across all pages. Collaborating closely with the backend development team, I ensured that the front-end and back-end functionalities were seamlessly integrated to provide a seamless experience to the users. Finally, I designed and developed a database schema using SQL to ensure the efficient storage and retrieval of data, resulting in improved application performance.</p>-->

                <h1>PARPAL</h1>
                <p> The ParPal golf application was developed collaboratively by our team of front-end and back-end developers. Together, we focused on creating a robust, user-friendly system that enabled users to search for golf courses, create events, find events, and connect with other golfers in the Dallas area. To achieve this, we utilized a variety of technologies, including Java, Javascript, Bootstrap, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and Google Maps and calendar APIs.</p>

                <p> As a team, we worked closely to ensure that the front-end and back-end components were seamlessly integrated, resulting in a reliable, scalable, and secure system. We designed a database schema using MySQL that enabled efficient storage and retrieval of data, and implemented various RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end systems. Additionally, we leveraged the Google Maps and calendar APIs to provide users with accurate course locations and event scheduling.</p>

                <p> Throughout the project, we learned the importance of clear communication, modular design, version control, and thorough testing. By adhering to these industry best practices, we were able to build a dependable and maintainable application that meets the needs of its users. The ParPal project has been a rewarding experience for all involved and has left us better equipped to tackle future development challenges as a team.</p>
